# Test-Pipeline-GCP
A demo of a GCP based CI/CD Pipeline

### Disclaimer
This project is purely for example/educational purposes. For a production static web page I would just publish the container and use [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en), which is much more cost effective

### TO-DO
- Re-add cosign for docker image signing
